# KOCMOC SVF Filter - Custom Layout

This repository contains a modified version of the [KOCMOC SVF filter](https://github.com/janne808/Kocmoc-Eurorack), originally created by janne808.
The modifications include a new PCB layout and panel design that are intended to be more user-friendly and visually appealing, while preserving the core functionality of the original circuit.

## Credits

The original KOCMOC SVF filter was designed by janne808 and released under the [CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal](https://ohwr.org/cernohl). I would like to thank janne808 for creating the original circuit and making it available under an open license, which allowed me to build upon it and create this modified version.

## Modifications

The modifications to the KOCMOC SVF filter consist of a new PCB layout and panel design, which were created to better fit my personal design system and style. Some of the specific changes include:

- Re-arranged and labeled the connectors on the PCB for easier connectivity.
- Changed the dimensions of the PCB and panel to better fit my preferred module size and layout.
- Updated the panel design to match my personal style, including color scheme and typography.
